    (*LiFePO4 battery*) or LFP battery (lithium ferrophosphate) is a type of lithium-ion
    battery using lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) as the cathode material, and a
    graphitic carbon electrode with a metallic backing as the anode.'

- context: Because of their low cost, high safety, low toxicity, long cycle life and
    other factors, LFP batteries are finding a number of roles in vehicle use, utility-scale
    stationary applications, and backup power. LFP batteries are cobalt-free. As of
    September 2022, LFP type battery market share for EVs reached 31%, and of that,
    68% were from EV makers Tesla and BYD alone. Chinese manufacturers currently hold
    a near monopoly of LFP battery type production. With patents having started to
    expire in 2022 and the increased demand for cheaper EV batteries, LFP type production
    is expected to rise further and surpass lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides
    (NMC) type batteries in 2028. The specific energy of LFP batteries is lower than
    that of other common lithium-ion battery types such as nickel manganese cobalt
    (NMC) and nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA).

- context: '## Viable alternative to lead-acid batteries Because of the nominal 3.2
    V output, four cells can be placed in series for a nominal voltage of 12.8 V.
    This comes close to the nominal voltage of six-cell lead-acid batteries. Along
    with the good safety characteristics of LFP batteries, this makes LFP a good potential
    replacement for lead-acid batteries in applications such as automotive and solar
    applications, provided the charging systems are adapted not to damage the LFP
    cells through excessive charging voltages (beyond 3.6 volts DC per cell while
    under charge), temperature-based voltage compensation, equalisation attempts or
    continuous trickle charging. The LFP cells must be at least balanced initially
    before the pack is assembled and a protection system also needs to be implemented
    to ensure no cell can be discharged below a voltage of 2.5 V or severe damage
    will occur in most instances, due to irreversible deintercalation of LiFePO4 into
    FePO4.'

    question: What is a potential application for LFP batteries that is similar to
      lead-acid batteries?
- context: The fully lithiated and unlithiated states of LiFePO4 are structurally
    similar which means that LiFePO4 cells are more structurally stable than LiCoO2
    cells. No lithium remains in the cathode of a fully charged LFP cell. In a LiCoO2
    cell, approximately 50% remains. LiFePO4 is highly resilient during oxygen loss,
    which typically results in an exothermic reaction in other lithium cells.

      have a similar structure in the fully lithiated and unlithiated states.
    question: Why are LiFePO4 cells more structurally stable than LiCoO2 cells?
  - answer: No lithium remains in the cathode of a fully charged LFP cell.

      LiCoO2 cell?

    (especially during charge). The LiFePO4 battery does not decompose at high temperatures.
    ## Lower energy density The energy density (energy/volume) of a new LFP battery
    is some 14% lower than that of a new LiCoO2 battery. Since discharge rate is a
    percentage of battery capacity, a higher rate can be achieved by using a larger
    battery (more ampere hours) if low-current batteries must be used.'
